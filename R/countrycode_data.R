#' Country Code Translation Data Frame
#'
#' A data frame with 262 observations on the following 19 variables.
#' Used internally by the \code{countrycode()} function.
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item country.name: Long country name
#'   \item country.name.de: Long German country name
#'   \item cowc: Correlates of War character
#'   \item cown: Correlates of War numeric
#'   \item fao: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations numerical code
#'   \item fips104: FIPS 10-4 (Federal Information Processing Standard)
#'   \item imf: International Monetary Fund
#'   \item iso2c: ISO-2 character
#'   \item iso3c: ISO-3 character
#'   \item iso2n: ISO-2 numeric
#'   \item iso3n: ISO-3 numeric
#'   \item un: United Nations numerical code
#'   \item wb: World Bank (very similar but not identical to iso3c)
#'   \item ioc: International Olympic Committee
#'   \item regex: Regular expression used to convert long names to code
#'   \item regex.de: Regular expression used to convert long German names to code
#'   \item region: Regions as defined in the World Bank Development Indicators
#'   \item continent: Continent as defined in the World Bank Development Indicators
#'   \item eu28: Memberstates of the European Union (as of December 2015),
#'              without special territories
#'   \item ar5: IPCC's regional mapping used both in the Fifth Assessment Report
#'             (AR5) and for the Reference Concentration Pathways (RCP)
#'
#' }
#'
#' @note To produce consistent conversion, some entries had to be removed from the
#'     conversion data frame. For example, the Correlates of War include 4 different
#'     codes to represent Western Germany. "countrycode" uses only one of them (CoW
#'     code 260 for all years). Similar choices were made in the cases of Korea,
#'     Yemen, Congo and Vietnam. Also, Namibia's iso2c code ("NA") can be understood
#'     as a missing observation (NA) by R.
#'
#'     Capitalized country names refer to the official short English names, as defined
#'     by the ISO organization. ISO does not publish official short English names for
#'     countries whose name is not capitalized in the the country.name vector. Continent
#'     and region information was taken from the UN website.
#'
#'     This is a (possibly incomplete) list of countries and codes that were dropped:
#'
#'     KOREA, REPUBLIC OF: cown 731 730, cowc PRK KOR
#'     YEMEN: cown 680 678, cowc YAR YPR
#'     GERMANY: cown 267 260 245, cowc BAV GFR BAD
#'     CONGO: cown 490, cowc 484
#'     VIET NAM: cown 816, cowc DRV
